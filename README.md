# Dragon's Dogamma Modpack for Dragon's Dogma 2

This modpack focuses on making Dragon's Dogma 2 more challenging by making fights harder, gear harder to acquire and harder to empower, vocations more balanced and monster encounters more varied and more interesting. What’s inside you may ask?

- Bosses drop random gear: worked a lot on updating the Lucky Scavenger code and improving the gear drop balance and system. The loot quality is based on the XP amount given by the boss.
- Harder boss fights: much less stagger, more damage done to player, some bosses can simply not be defeated until you have proper gear and level. Don’t expect to kill a chimera or a drake at lv 15.
- Harder and more balanced enemies: even a crowd of base enemies at the start can mean your end. And if you don’t get well prepared for new areas, you will be crushed.
- No gear in shops : money doesn’t buy gear. You need to find the gear by exploring, opening chests and killing bosses.
- Much more expensive gear upgrades: most of your money will allow to you to upgrade your gear. Upgrades also require double the amount of materials.
- Random items drop when scavenging items in the wild: there’s always a reason to loot everything you see.
- Items in chests are modified: no prior knowledge of the game loot will help you cheese the game's progression.
- Random chance of looting ferrystones on dead enemies and in chests.
- Lock-on system for combat and dodge for all classes.
- Less staggers for the player.
- A more permissive Loss Gauge since you'll take much more damages in general.

And much more!

But why “Dogamma”?

- Dogmas are  kind of restrictive and something you do not really want.
- Dodogamas on the other hand are super cute monsters from Monster Hunter, another Capcom franchise.
- I am the author of STALKER GAMMA, a gigantic modpack for STALKER Anomaly (500+ mods).
